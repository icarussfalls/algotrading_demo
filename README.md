# algotrading_demo
This is a demo of my personal project, which utilizes ensemble machine learning (ML) models to execute trades in financial markets. The strategy is built on two ML models, namely Transformers and LSTM.

The Transformers model is employed to generate predicted returns, which are then used in Bayesian updating to determine trades. Additionally, Transformers is utilized to forecast market regime by analyzing autocorrelation, partial correlation, and lag features. This information enhances the trades generated by the LSTM model.

To maintain a record of model predictions, the data is saved to a database every 15 minutes using SQLITE3.

Furthermore, a trailing stop loss mechanism has been incorporated to account for instances when the market behaves irrationally. After the stop loss is triggered, a cooldown period of 15 minutes is enforced before new trades can be initiated.
